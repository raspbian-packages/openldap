openldap (2.5.5+dfsg-1~exp1) experimental; urgency=medium

   This is a major release of OpenLDAP, and as such it introduces several
   changes, new features and deprecations/removals.  This is a
   non-exhaustive list of things to be aware of:

   * Changes:
     - The libldap2-dev package has been renamed to libldap-dev.
     - The libldap_r library has been merged into libldap.
       Applications should link with -lldap. This package still provides
       a libldap_r.so symlink for compatibility.
